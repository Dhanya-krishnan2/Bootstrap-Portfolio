# bootsrapportfolio
This is portfolio website which is having minimum functionality by using HTML, CSS, AND BOOTSTRAP . 
I have used the built in classes of bootstrap and which helps me to use less css customisation. That is the way I can maintain my code to minimum. 
I have added the images and added the resume to have look with.


This is my deployed link of my portfolio:
